                <h3>Methods We used</h3>
                <p>
                    A neuropsychological evaluation uses standardized psychometric instruments (along with interview data, behavioral observations, and review of pertinent records) to assess an individual’s profile of cognitive strengths and weaknesses.
                    Neuropsychological data are typically interpreted by comparing the scores achieved by the examinee to those of a normative comparison group (i.e., a large group of individuals who were administered the test during the standardization process).
                    This comparison can be done automatically in this website. The calculation of each test is done as instructed by the manual of the test.
                    The normative comparison group used to interpret each test performance in a given neuropsychological evaluation is selected so as to be similar to the examinee in terms of key demographic variables that can impact performance on that measure such as age, education, and sometimes gender. By comparing the examinee’s score on each neuropsychological measure to the scores achieved by the normative comparison group, a percentile rank (“%ile”) can be calculated. This percentile rank typically represents the percentage of individuals in the normative comparison group with scores at or below the examinee’s score on that particular instrument. Thus, as an example, a percentile rank of 75 on a given measure means that 75% of the normative group scored equal to or below the examinee on that test, whereas only 25% (i.e., 100% minus 75%) performed better than the examinee. Likewise, a percentile rank of 2 means that only 2% of the normative group scored equal to or worse than the examinee, whereas 98% of the normative group scored better than the examinee on that measure.
                    In order to aid in the interpretation of the large amount of quantitative data generated by a neuropsychological assessment, ranges of percentile scores are typically labeled with qualitative “performance ratings.”
                    <br/>The following descriptors are used to characterize or “rate” the examinee’s performance on each of the neurocognitive measures:
                    <br/>
                    Impaired (for scores that fall at or below the 2%ile);
                    <br/>
                    Borderline (for scores that fall between the 3%ile and the 8%ile);
                    <br/>
                    Low Average (for scores that fall between the 9%ile and the 24%ile);
                    <br/>
                    Average (for scores that fall between the 25%ile and the 74%ile);
                    <br/>
                    High Average (for scores that fall between the 75%ile and the 90%ile);
                    <br/>
                    Superior (for scores that fall between the 91%ile and the 97%ile);
                    <br/>
                    Very Superior (for scores that are at or above the 98%ile).
